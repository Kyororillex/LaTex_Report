! LaTeX Error: This file needs format `pLaTeX2e'
               but this is `LaTeX2e'.

See the LaTeX manual or LaTeX Companion for explanation.
Type  H <return>  for immediate help.
 ...

The current input file will not be processed further,
because it was written for some other flavor of TeX.
You're in trouble here.  Try typing  <return>  to proceed.
If that doesn't work, type  X <return>  to quit.
